# The Open Red Button Project

## Project Overview

The Open Red Button Project (ORB) is an open source project that adds HbbTV support to browsers. It uses JavaScript and C++ components to enhance browsers with HbbTV functionality. ORB includes libraries for integration with Android's WebView and RDK's WPE.

The ORB project is designed as a reference implementation and requires additional modifications, including minor browser patches, for use in production. Ocean Blue Software (OBS), the creators of ORB, are experienced in making these modifications and integrating ORB into production devices. **For commercial support and discussion about how OBS can help with your project, contact OBS at [info@oceanbluesoftware.co.uk](mailto:info@oceanbluesoftware.co.uk).**

## Development Status
We are in the process of updating ORB to include HbbTV OpApp support. As a result the **master** branch is subject to frequent chance, is unstable, and may not build successfully. 

For a stable ORB release, please use the **[orb 1.0][https://github.com/OpenRedButtonProject/orb/tree/v1.0]** branch, which is maintained with bug fixes and critical updates.  If you are interested in the feature roadmap for ORB, please contact OBS at [info@oceanbluesoftware.co.uk](mailto:info@oceanbluesoftware.co.uk).

## Contribute

If you are not otherwise coordinated with the project, raise a [new issue](https://github.com/OpenRedButtonProject/Orb/issues) before starting work on a new fix or feature to avoid duplicated effort.

1. Create or update your fork of the repository to work in.
2. Create a new topic branch on master and complete the fix or feature.
3. Open a pull request. You may find that upstream master has changed and you need to rebase your branch.

The maintainer will squash and merge your branch if it is accepted or they will comment on the pull request.
